Q1)
The equations x = 2 and y = 4 represent vertical lines that intersect at the point (2, 4).

The equation x = 2 represents a vertical line passing through the x-coordinate 2. It means that for any value of y, the x-coordinate is always 2. So, all the points on this line have an x-coordinate of 2.

Similarly, the equation y = 4 represents a horizontal line passing through the y-coordinate 4. For any value of x, the y-coordinate is always 4. Therefore, all the points on this line have a y-coordinate of 4.

Since both lines have the same x and y coordinates, they intersect at the point (2, 4).




Q2)
To determine the number of solutions for the system of equations 2X + 3Y = 9 and 7X + 9Y = -6, we can analyze the coefficients of X and Y and compare the equations.

One approach is to use the determinant of the coefficient matrix to determine the type of solution. The determinant can be calculated as follows:

D = (2 * 9) - (3 * 7) = 18 - 21 = -3.

If the determinant (D) is not equal to zero, the system has a unique solution. If D is equal to zero, we need to further analyze the equations to determine the solution type.

In this case, D = -3, which means the system has a unique solution (a unique point of intersection) because the determinant is not zero.

Therefore, the system of equations 2X + 3Y = 9 and 7X + 9Y = -6 has a unique solution.




Q3)
The equation 7x + 9y = -5 represents a linear equation in two variables, x and y. However, your question about "keys" seems unclear. If you meant "solutions" or "roots," I can help you determine the number of solutions.

To determine the number of solutions for this equation, we need more information or another equation. A single equation in two variables can have an infinite number of solutions or no solution at all, depending on the relationship between the coefficients and constants.

If you provide another equation or additional information, I can assist you further in determining the number of solutions.


Q4)
For the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, if a = b = c = 0, the equation becomes 0x^2 + 0x + 0 = 0.

In this case, the equation simplifies to 0 = 0. This means that every value of x satisfies the equation.

Therefore, when a = b = c = 0, the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is true for all values of x. It has infinite solutions.


Q5)
Let's assume the income of person A is 2x, and the income of person B is 3x. According to the given information, B's income is Rs 3000, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 3000

Solving for x, we find x = 1000. Therefore, A's income is 2x = 2 * 1000 = Rs 2000.

Now, let's consider their savings. A's savings are given as Rs 500, and B's savings are given as Rs 700.

To find their expenditures, we subtract the savings from their respective incomes:

A's expenditure = A's income - A's savings = Rs 2000 - Rs 500 = Rs 1500
B's expenditure = B's income - B's savings = Rs 3000 - Rs 700 = Rs 2300

Therefore, the ratio of their expenditures is 1500:2300, which can be simplified to 15:23.
