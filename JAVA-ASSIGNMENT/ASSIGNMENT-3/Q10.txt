Q10.What is the final class in Java?

In Java, the "final" keyword can be used in different contexts. However, when referring to the "final class," it means a class that cannot be subclassed.
 In other words, a final class is one that cannot be extended by other classes.

When a class is declared as final using the "final" keyword, it prevents other classes from inheriting from it. This is useful when you want to restrict the 
inheritance of a class to maintain control over its behavior and prevent any modifications to its implementation.

final class MyFinalClass {
    // Class implementation
}
In this example, the class MyFinalClass is declared as final. As a result, it cannot be extended by any other class using the extends keyword.
 If you attempt to create a subclass of MyFinalClass, the compiler will generate an error.

To summarize, a final class in Java is one that cannot be subclassed or inherited by other classes, providing a way to enforce the class's
 implementation and prevent modifications through inheritance.
