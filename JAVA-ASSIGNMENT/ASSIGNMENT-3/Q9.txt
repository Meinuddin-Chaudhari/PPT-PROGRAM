Q9.What is an abstraction explained with an Example?


Abstraction is a concept in Java that allows you to represent complex real-world entities as simplified models in code. 
It focuses on defining the essential characteristics and behavior of an object while hiding unnecessary details. Let's explain abstraction with an example in Java:

Example: Shape Abstraction
// Abstract class representing a shape
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
    abstract double calculateArea();
}

// Concrete class representing a circle
class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }

    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

// Concrete class representing a rectangle
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing
