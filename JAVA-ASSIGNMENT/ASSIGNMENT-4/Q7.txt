Q7.Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?


Yes, in Java, you can pass lambda expressions as arguments to methods. This is possible when the method parameter type is a functional interface, which means it has a single abstract method.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to pass a lambda expression as a method argument:

java
Copy code
// Functional interface with a single abstract method
interface MyFunction {
    int apply(int a, int b);
}

public class LambdaMethodArgumentExample {
    // Method that takes a functional interface as a parameter
    public static void performOperation(int a, int b, MyFunction function) {
        int result = function.apply(a, b);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using a lambda expression as a method argument
        performOperation(5, 3, (x, y) -> x + y);
    }
}
