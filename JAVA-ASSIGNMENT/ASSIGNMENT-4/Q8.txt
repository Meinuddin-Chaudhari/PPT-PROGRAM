Q8.What is the functional interface in Java 8?


In Java 8, a functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method. Functional interfaces are also known as single abstract method (SAM) interfaces.

The concept of functional interfaces is closely related to lambda expressions and the functional programming paradigm.
 Functional interfaces serve as the foundation for lambda expressions and provide a way to represent and encapsulate behavior.

Here are some key points about functional interfaces in Java 8:

Single Abstract Method (SAM): A functional interface must have exactly one abstract method. This abstract method represents the behavior or functionality that is to be encapsulated by the lambda expression.

Default and Static Methods: In addition to the single abstract method, a functional interface can also contain default and static methods. Default methods provide a default implementation for methods in the interface, while static methods are common utility methods.

Marker Annotation: To ensure that an interface is a functional interface, the @FunctionalInterface marker annotation can be used. Although this annotation is optional, it is good practice to include it to explicitly indicate the intended purpose of the interface.

Lambda Expressions and Method References: Functional interfaces are designed to be used with lambda expressions and method references. Lambda expressions provide a concise syntax for implementing the abstract method of a functional interface. Method references allow you to refer to an existing method as the implementation of the abstract method.
